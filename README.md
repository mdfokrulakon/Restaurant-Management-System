## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Oracle SQL
- PL/SQL Compatibility
- Relational Database Design with Constraints and Keys

## üìÅ File Structure

- `DROP_TABLES.sql`: Drops all tables in dependency order with `CASCADE CONSTRAINTS`.
- `CREATE_TABLES.sql`: Creates all necessary tables with proper keys and constraints.
- `INSERT_USERS.sql`: Inserts default users into the `USERS` table.

## ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you are connected to an Oracle SQL database environment.
2. Run the `DROP_TABLES.sql` script to clear previous instances.
3. Run the `CREATE_TABLES.sql` script to recreate the schema.
4. (Optional) Populate with test data using `INSERT_USERS.sql`.

## üìå Note

- Referential integrity is strictly enforced using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
- Use `CASCADE CONSTRAINTS` when dropping tables to avoid dependency errors.
- All data types and field sizes are chosen for flexibility and normalization.
